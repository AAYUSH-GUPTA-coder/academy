# Open Zeppelin Smart Contract Concepts 

Open Zeppelin developed a lot of standard contracts that are super powerful, widely used and fully <br>
tested and audited. We are going to stand on the shoulder of giants and leverage the power of open <br>
source to create our project in a simpler way, while not losing focus on security which is super important <br>
in the web3 world.

**The Zeppelin that Opened Ethereum…or something cheesy like that**

In the early days of smart contract development, we developers didn’t have any standard contracts, we just <br>
wrote our own, tested them as best we could, and did a lot of *hoping for the best* that they wouldn’t get hacked. <br>
Since the space was new, there was a real need for developers who would specialise in rigorously auditing contracts, <br>
since they were holding a lot of value.

The Open Zeppelin team, slowly but surely, began to fill that gap creating a library of contracts that *have* been rigorously <br>
audited and proven to be safe and robust by all the OG protocols of the Ethereum Network, and many more. 

**So what are they and how do they help us?**

By (re)using and these Open Zeppelin libraries, we devs can reduce the amount of code we write, and that's a good thing. By <br> 
reducing the *surface area for attack vectors* our contracts are much less likely to be hacked. Since they are often used as an <br>
ecosystem standard, they allow for much easier collaboration among humans, and interoperability with the technology <br>
those humans create in their code.

In the beginning the OZ contracts were quite basic, but over time they have gotten much richer and more modular, opening up loads <br>
of possibilities. And when we pair this with the evolution of ERC standards and tokens, which we also look at, the field of <br>
possibilities opens up exponentially. Exciting times to be developing!

To make development easier still and take advantage of their offerings, there is an OpenZeppeilin Wizard which lets you <br>
choose your own style of modularity, whether that is to mint, burn, vote, give a range of access permissions, you name it, <br>
it’s there! Note the import of ERC721 in the one below…..I’ll stop nattering now! See for yourself:

‘So when we write a new contract, and we need to ***inherit*** the tried and tested qualities or characteristics, we <br>
simply ***import*** those contracts into our own, like inheriting those good qualities of our favourite relatives!

It’s very rare in the Ethereum smart contract development spere to see a smart contract that doesn’t include at least one <br>
line of code stating **import: OpenZeppelin_something_or_other!.sol!**
