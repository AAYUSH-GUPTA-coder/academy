## Solidity Fundamental Side Drawers for Lesson 3

### constant/immutable
    - We could integrate this into the Variables & Types SideDrawer from Lesson 1 mappings
    - 2 or 3 paragraphs (How keys are stored and why that doesn't let you iterate)




### mint function
    - Same as Lesson 2




### payable functions
    - msg.value




### balances





### withdraw functions
    - Ownable / onlyOwner
    - sending ether (call vs. send vs. transfer)
