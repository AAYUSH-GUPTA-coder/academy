# How to install node.js and npm

![NPM Overload Joke](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/npm-jokes-1.png)

**NPM is probably the best known package manager for setting up and running a `node.js` <br>
project. When `node.js` is installed, `npm` gets installed with it, so there is no need to install <br>
`npm` separately. NPM sets up the development environment of your project, which in our case we <br>
are using hardhat as our development environment, and installs important dependencies, <br>
which are other pieces of software that are needed to help the core software of the project run.  <br>
Examples of dependencies are OpenZeppelin/contracts, ethers.js, chai or typescript.** 

<h3>Choose your operating system and setup from the choices below:</h3>

<h2>Installing node.js and npm with nvm on Windows 10/WSL2</h2>

**If your operating system is Windows 10 or 11 and you have not installed WSL-2 yet, <br>
Microsoft has a pretty good article that can help you install Linux on your Windows machine <br>
here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install .  One minor change to the <br>
directions should be to the commands to add a specific distribution. You will want to <br>
choose the Ubuntu Linux distribution, so you will want to use the following command when <br>
installing WSL with the command line, wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04. This will ensure <br>
that a long-term supported version of Ubuntu Linux is installed on WSL-2. If you need <br>
additional info, you can also refer to the Tooling section of Lesson 2, which gives direction on <br>
operating systems, a command line mini-lesson and more.**

<h3>Letâ€™s get the party started and install `npm` on WSL2!</h3>

1. ** Click on the Windows Start Button, then open Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows.**
