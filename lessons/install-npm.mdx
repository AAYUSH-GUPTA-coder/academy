# How to install node.js and npm

![NPM Overload Joke](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/npm-jokes-1.png)

**NPM is probably the best known package manager for setting up and running a `node.js` <br>
project. When `node.js` is installed, `npm` gets installed with it, so there is no need to install <br>
`npm` separately. NPM sets up the development environment of your project, which in our case we <br>
are using hardhat as our development environment, and installs important dependencies, <br>
which are other pieces of software that are needed to help the core software of the project run.  <br>
Examples of dependencies are OpenZeppelin/contracts, ethers.js, chai or typescript.** 

<h3>Choose your operating system and setup from the choices below:</h3>

<h2>Installing node.js and npm with nvm on Windows 10/WSL2</h2>

**If your operating system is Windows 10 or 11 and you have not installed WSL-2 yet, <br>
Microsoft has a pretty good article that can help you install Linux on your Windows machine <br>
here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install .  One minor change to the <br>
directions should be to the commands to add a specific distribution. You will want to <br>
choose the Ubuntu Linux distribution, so you will want to use the following command when <br>
installing WSL with the command line, wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04. This will ensure <br>
that a long-term supported version of Ubuntu Linux is installed on WSL-2. If you need <br>
additional info, you can also refer to the Tooling section of Lesson 2, which gives direction on <br>
operating systems, a command line mini-lesson and more.**

<h3>Let‚Äôs get the party started and install `npm` on WSL2!</h3>

<h3>Click on the Windows Start Button, then open Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows.</h3>

**We need to install curl into our WSL-2 instance, so type into the command line, <br>
`sudo apt-get install curl`. You may be prompted for a password. It is the same password <br>
you created when you first set up WSL-2. You are prompted to use the password because you are <br>
using `sudo` which is ‚Äúsuper user permission‚Äù. `cURL` allows us to to download necessary software <br>
from outside software library servers.**

**Next, we want to install Node Version Manager (nvm). NVM is a super helpful tool because <br>
it allows you to download and run different versions of npm. In our command line, we need to <br>
copy and paste the following command:<br>
`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash` <br>
and hit Enter. Let‚Äôs verify that it was installed correctly by typing `command -v nvm`. <br>
This should return nvm if it was installed correctly. If you get an error or no output, <br>
close the Ubuntu terminal down and restart it. It should now return nvm.**

**We‚Äôre all ready to install our first version of node.js! üëç For this demo, <br>
I installed node.js version 14.16.0. In the command line type `nvm install 14.16.0` <br>
and hit enter. This will install this version of node.js and it can be verified by <br>
typing `node -v` for the node.js version and `npm -v` for the npm version. In the event <br>
that you need a different version of node.js, the commands `nvm install <VERSION>` will <br>
install the new version.**

**After you have installed a few different versions of node.js depending on the requirements <br>
of your projects, you can list the versions using the `nvm ls` command.**
