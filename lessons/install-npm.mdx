# How to install node.js and npm

![NPM Overload Joke](/public/assets/lessons/install_npm/npm-jokes-1.png)

**`NPM` is probably the best known package manager for setting up and running a `node.js` <br>
project. When `node.js` is installed, `npm` gets installed with it, so there is no need to install <br>
`npm` separately. NPM sets up the development environment of your project, which in our case we <br>
are using hardhat as our development environment, and installs important dependencies, <br>
which are other pieces of software that are needed to help the core software of the project run.  <br>
Examples of dependencies are OpenZeppelin/contracts, ethers.js, chai or typescript.**
